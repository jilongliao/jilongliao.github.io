## TL;DR

I started to intentionally see how much AI can impact my life over the holiday, so I incorporate as many AI tools as possible into my daily life, both at work and at home. I wrote down some of the scenarios I encountered with AI and shared my experience and thoughts.

## When I ask what, why or how?

Asking "what, why and how" happens a lot for me. I search things like "what is flood insurance, and why people buy it". My typical workflow is having a Chrome tab open and another tab to research. I search from the address bar (yes, I like to do it). Then open more tabs to dive deep. The amount tab and window switches are a lot. After years, my tab/switching is seamless now but I'd like to avoid. I used ChatGPT desktop on my mac, perplexity etc. It saves a lot of tabs I have to open when I do research, and that's where most of back-and-forth Q&A happens.

Ideally, in-context chat is very convenient and many of my productivity apps have integrations. However, they have slightly different experience when prompting with its underlying LLM. This makes a bit annoy that I have to tune my prompts to make it more efficient, but I get it that GPT might be different from Claude models just like talking with different people. Perhaps, it's a skill to learn how to work with different LLMs.

## When I want to learn things fast!

I have a lot of curiosity about different things, so I often spend time to research them. For instance, I learn enconomics during my leisure time. I learn by visual and listening the most and am slow in reading. But I discovered [Google's NotebookLM][1], a great product fits me well. I dump the stuff I need to learn - links, PDFs, videos - it summarizes and extracts the knowledge with me. I can interact with it and do Q&A. The most effective feature to me is the **audio generation** where a two people discussion audio is generated. I just listen and learn it. This works with me very well. This also reminds how important product-market fit is for AI.

> A side note on NotebookLM: it is also a good tool to produce your Podcast. I actually also found NotebookLM generated Podcast on https://www.xiaohongshu.com.

## Listen to music

Music is important to me. I listen Spotify everyday. I learned [Suno][2] from a Podcast and tried it out. It's cool! It's a good supplement to my current Spotify playlist. My kid and I have some fun to play with it and produce our music. Try [this one][3] from the below prompt:

```
I want to write a song. Today is the best day ever. I had a lot of fun with my friends and play toys. I am very happy.
```

However, the generated music often lacks of emotion. The music is pretty much emotional netural. I changed a few prompts to try to enforce emotions, but failed. Unlike generated music, human music is emotional containgeous as it compresses more than just lyrics and sound but life as well. 

## Help answer my kid's "why" question

My kid really likes to ask why every day. I found myself limited to some of his "whys". Glady, I find Google's [Learn About][4] is a great tool to save me. For instance, we were talking about **blackhole** and I use *learn about*. It's an interesting experience with text and video explaination together.

## When I want to research financial stuff

The financial world has a lot of content that sometimes is hard to understand. I often look at examples. Having GPT to provide examples are pretty useful to quickly grasp the concept. I would definitely double check it, but so far it seems to be ok with the factual stuff. An example on "the wheels option strategy" below.

Next, I asked a more opinionated question regarding Tesla stock price. GPT is conservative and only refer to Internet resources. IMO, it is probably the right thing to do. I don't think I will purely rely on GPT to make financial decisions. I expect some good AI Agents in financial space will come up to assist the analysis process.

## My side husle helper

Side husle is a great way for me to test out new ideas. When I write code, and [Cursor][5] is my friend. I am actually impressed by how much Cursor can accomplish when helping me coding. The `tab tab` experience is good. The `.cursorrules` are helpful to make repo wide changes too. As an engineer myself, Cursor is super helpful and enough. I also learned [Devin][6] is good too. I categorize myself as a `builder`. Writing code is part of me, I'd prefer tools to help me achieve the code I want to write instead of creating the entire application for me.

Multimodal is very powerful. I used it to create logo for a Podcast. I am happy with the result.

## My thoughts for now

- Various AI tools are boosting my productivity for sure. I used it mostly for factual Q&As for now. I'm actually exciting about the upcoming waves of AI Agents that could help take actions for me.
- For education, NotebookLM and Learn About are very good AI product for learn and discover.
- For creative work, how does the generation relates to people's life is the key. Solving it perhaps will release the power of creativity generation.
